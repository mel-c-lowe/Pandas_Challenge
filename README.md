For this assignment, I was given a fictitious dataset with district-wide standardized test results for math and reading, along with information on the schools attended by each student.  From this data, I provided numerous summaries in table form (listed below), as well as a narrative anaylisis of overall findings.



### District Summary

* Ahigh level snapshot (in table form) of the district's key metrics, including:
  * Total Schools
  * Total Students
  * Total Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

### School Summary

* An overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:
  * School Name
  * School Type
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per Student Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

### Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)

* A table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include:
  * School Name
  * School Type
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per Student Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

### Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)

* A table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Including the previously included metrics.

### Math Scores by Grade

* Atable that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Reading Scores by Grade

* A table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Scores by School Spending

* A table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (per student).  Include in the table each of the following:
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

### Scores by School Size

* A table with the same breakdown as above but separating schools by size (small, medium, large).

### Scores by School Type

* A table with the same breakdown as above but separating schools by type (Charter vs. District).
